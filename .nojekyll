# This file tells GitHub Pages to NOT process this site with Jekyll
# It only needs to exist (empty file is fine)
# 
# Why needed:
# - GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default
# - Jekyll ignores files/folders starting with underscore (_)
# - Vite builds may create _assets or similar folders
# - This empty file disables Jekyll processing
# - Allows all Vite build files to be served correctly
